# Passive Smartphone-Derived Keystroke Dynamics Analysis Using Semi-Supervised Approach
About Our HealthTech Startup
Welcome to our HealthTech startup dedicated to improving quality care for individuals with neuro and chronic diseases. We focus on leveraging passive smartphone-derived keystroke dynamics analysis using a semi-supervised approach to enhance healthcare outcomes.

# Mission
Our mission is to predict keypresses and mobile display interactions using accelerometer data collected passively from smartphones. By analyzing keystroke dynamics and behavioral patterns, we aim to provide personalized healthcare solutions that empower patients and healthcare providers.

# Data Information
Data for keypresses, accelerometer, and gyroscope is collected through the use of a smartphone keyboard. Here are the specifics:

# Data Collection Period: Approximately 80 days of keyboard sessions.
User Diversity: Data includes sessions from multiple users.
Daily Sessions: Each day includes multiple keyboard sessions for comprehensive analysis.
# Challenges
Combining Data Frames: Integrating data from different sources (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, keyboard) into cohesive data frames poses challenges due to varying data formats and timestamps.

Labeling: Accurately labeling keystroke events and mobile display interactions for supervised learning is challenging, requiring robust algorithms and manual verification processes.

Session Selection for Effective Prediction: Choosing relevant keyboard sessions for predictive analysis involves selecting sessions with sufficient data quality and representative user behaviors.

# Solutions
Resampling on Timestamps: Use resampling techniques to align timestamps across keystroke, accelerometer, and gyroscope data frames, ensuring synchronization for accurate analysis.

Windowing: Implement windowing techniques to segment data into smaller, manageable time intervals. This facilitates feature extraction and pattern recognition from sequential data.

Accelerometer Magnitude: Calculate accelerometer magnitude as a feature to capture overall device movement and gestures, providing additional context for keystroke dynamics analysis.

# Outlook
Train Model Using Data from Multiple Users: Utilize data from multiple users to train machine learning models, preventing overfitting to individual user behaviors and enhancing generalizability.

Further Preprocessing of Accelerometer Data: Explore advanced preprocessing techniques to capture additional mobility states from accelerometer data, potentially improving predictive accuracy and insights into user mobility patterns.
